Mem0 includes built-in support for various popular large language models. Memory can utilize the LLM provided by the user, ensuring efficient use for specific needs.

## Usage

To use a llm, you must provide a configuration to customize its usage. If no configuration is supplied, a default configuration will be applied, and `OpenAI` will be used as the llm.

For a comprehensive list of available parameters for llm configuration, please refer to [Config](./config).

To view all supported llms, visit the [Supported LLMs](./models).
